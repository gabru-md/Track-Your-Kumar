## The Problem

Systematic paperwork delay affects lots of people everyday. As an example... You go to the concerned signatory's office with the most urgent paperwork only to find out that he has not come in because he has the flu. The frustration itself is enough to make one mad ðŸ˜ 

## The Solution

**HACKIIITD**  
Exploiting existing attendance systems in offices to show the public whether the officer assigned with their particular concern is in the office or not. This can be used in banks, government offices, colleges, schools, and pretty much every customer facing business can use this... 

## Features

Real-time - Data is updated at each and every sign-in and sign-out.<br>
Accurate - Data is taken from the company's own attendance database.<br>
        * Alerts - Set an alert for a specific person or position. // Will add, Maybe!
