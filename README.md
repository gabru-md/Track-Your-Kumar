## The Problem

Millions of man-hours are wasted every year by people waiting for an authority to sign off on their paperwork. You go to the concerned signatory's office with the most urgent paperwork only to find out that he has not come in because he has the flu. The frustration itself is enough to make one mad.

## The Solution

Our software. It exploits already existing attendance systems in offices to show the public whether the officer concerned with their particular concern is in the office or not. A simple enough idea which is easily executable will make the lives of countless working people far easier. Our software will take customer relations to a whole new level. The software can be used in banks, government offices, colleges, schools, pretty much every customer facing business can use our software to improve customer relations.. 

## Features

Real-time - Data is updated at each and every sign-in and sign-out.<br>
Accurate - Data is taken from the company's own attendance database.<br>
        * Alerts - Set an alert for a specific person or position. // Will add, Maybe!
