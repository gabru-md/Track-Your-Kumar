'Track Your Kumar'

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## The Problem

Millions of man-hours are wasted every year by people waiting for an authority to sign off on their paperwork. You go to the concerned signatory's office with the most urgent paperwork only to find out that he has not come in because he has the flu. The frustration itself is enough to make one mad.

## The Solution

Our software:
It exploits already existing attendance systems in offices to show the public whether the officer concerned with their particular concern is in the office or not. A simple idea which will make the lives of countless working people far easier. Our software will improve customer relations. The software can be used in banks, government offices, colleges, schools and other customer facing businesses can make use of our software.

## Features

Real-time - Data is updated with sign-in and sign-out.<br>
Accurate - Data is taken from the company's own attendance database.<br>
        * Alerts - Set an alert for a specific person or position. // Will add, Maybe!
